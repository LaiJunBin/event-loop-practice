## Why Did I Create This Tool?

I believe that grasping the event loop is crucial for anyone learning JavaScript, but it can be a bit challenging, especially for beginners. I found that the best way to truly understand it is through hands-on practice.

That's why I developed this tool â€“ to provide an engaging way for you to experiment with and comprehend the event loop.

On another note, I also plan to write a blog post about the event loop concept and share this practical tool with my readers.

## Why Isn't It Open Source?

While I would love to make this tool open source, due to time constraints, I haven't been able to refactor the code to a suitable state for public sharing. However, your input is valuable! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to create an issue in this repository.

## Technology Behind the Scenes

For those curious about the technologies I used to build this tool, here's a rundown of the libraries and tools:

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - A modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework to streamline styling.
- [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) - A syntax highlighting library for code snippets.
- [highlightjs-line-numbers.js](https://github.com/wcoder/highlightjs-line-numbers.js) - An extension for adding line numbers to highlighted code blocks.
- [sweetalert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) - A customizable and attractive replacement for JavaScript's native alert and confirmation dialogs.

To create the development environment, I utilized [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) along with [lai-cmd](https://github.com/laijunbin/lai-cmd).
