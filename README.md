## Why I made this tool?

I think the event loop is a very important concept in JavaScript, but it is not easy for beginners to understand.

I think the best way to understand it is to practice it.

So I made this tool.

On the other hand, I want to write a post about the event loop, and I want to share this tool in the post.

## Why not Open Source?

Because I have no time to refactor the code. and I think this practice tool does not much necessary to be open source.

If have any issues or suggestions, please create an issue in this repository.

## How I implement this tool?

If you're curious how I implemented this tool, the libraries used are listed below.

- [svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
- [highlightjs-line-numbers.js](https://github.com/wcoder/highlightjs-line-numbers.js)
